Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, object-oriented programming language. Its clean syntax makes programming easier and more productive. In my case the use of this language will be reserved for the moment for the creation of School-42 testers and some other personal projects

### Structure

1. Language Fundamentals
- Basic syntax
- Basic data types (numbers, strings, symbols, booleans)
- Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
- Variables and constants
2. Control Structures
- Conditionals (yes, else, elsif, unless)
- Loops (while, until, for, each)
- Iterators and blocks (times, up, down, each_with_index)
3. Methods and functions
- Definition and calling of methods
- Arguments and parameters
- Return values
- Predicate and bang methods
- Nested methods and recursion.
4. Data Structures
- Arrays
- hashes
- Ranks
- Useful methods for arrays and hashes.
5. Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- Initializers
- Instance attributes and methods
- Inheritance and modules
- Mixtures
- Class methods
6. Exception Handling
- Introduction to exceptions
- Error handling (start, rescue, secure)
- Create your own exceptions
7. Input and Output (I/O)
- Standard input and standard output
- Files and directories (reading and writing files)
- File manipulation
8. Bookstores and Gems
- Use of standard libraries
- Introduction to gems
- Installing and using gems with Bundler
9. Tests
- Introduction to testing in Ruby
- Use of Minitest and RSpec
- Write and run tests.
10. Tools and Good Practices
- Linters and code formatters
- Code documentation (RDoc, YARD)
- Git and version control in Ruby projects
11. Projects and Practical Exercises
- Small projects to apply the concepts learned.
- Practical exercises and coding challenges.
